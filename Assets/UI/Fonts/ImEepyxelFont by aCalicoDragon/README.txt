Thanks for getting my amazing im very eepy font, hope you have fun, do whatever you want with it, games, websites, anything, just credit me or I will eat you!!

The font works at sizes 8, 16, 24, 32, 64... Like all pixel fonts (probably lol)

If you find any weird looking letter, error or you want to see any change, just dm me on twitter or discord and I will see if I stop being eepy to fix it.

I also left a png and a .aseprite if you need it for any reason.
